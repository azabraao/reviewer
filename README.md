# reviewer
Review for trello is a chrome extension and my personal reviewer. I'm a passionate for self-development and I'm always trying to evolve my self-manage methods (I like to read about methods and then make my own personal experiments). 

If you read the code, you might not understand why this exists. And here it is: I give myself daily points. Each trello label has a number based on Fibonacci (yes, It comes direct from SCRUM). This extension helps me to calculate my score.
